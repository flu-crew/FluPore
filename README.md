# PURDY
Welcome to the GitHub repository and manual for the software PURDY!  PURDY stands for **P**ractical **U**tility for **R**ead **D**emultiplexing and assembl**Y** and is a fast and easy-to-use bash pipeline for MinION Influenza A sequences from any host and all gene segments that utilizes existing tools to perform demultiplexing and assembly, collect and calculate basic assembly statistics, generate phylogenetic trees alongside reference sequences, and classify swine HA sequences. PURDY is protected by a XXXXX liscence. Please cite XXXXX any time you present results generated using PURDY especially in a peer-reviewed publication. The aforementioned manuscript is also an important place to gain a complete understanding of the software and reading it is our recommended first step before using PURDY.
